# Hand Gesture controlled Pacman game

### This project was implemented by using JavaScript to create the game and TensorflowJS to recognize the gestures.

### Enter "yarn add" to add all the required dependencies
### Then enter "yarn start" to start the server
### Once the server is started, click some images of the gestures for their respective move and then train the network by pressing the train button
### Once the training is done, you can start playing the game by using those gestures.
